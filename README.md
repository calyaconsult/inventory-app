# Inventory App

After reading Rowan Cheung's post on X (https://x.com/rowancheung/status/1934518069939814567) I tried Tallinn-based Flowstep's product at at https://flowstep.ai/ and was amazed how easy it was to get a wireframe for a mobile app.

I uploaded the wireframe to different LLM chats and found ChatGPT's version the most satisfying of all.

You'll find the wireframe and the HHTML/CSS/JS app here in this repo.
